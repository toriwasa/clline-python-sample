# Project Brief

## Core Requirements and Goals

This project implements a Python-based system following domain-driven design principles, focusing on:

- Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Type-safe and well-tested code
- Data processing using Apache Spark
- Command-line interface (CUI) for interaction

### Primary Goals
1. Implement a maintainable and scalable data processing system
2. Follow strict architectural patterns for code organization
3. Ensure high code quality through linting and type checking
4. Provide comprehensive test coverage

## Project Scope

### Component Structure
- Domain models for data representation
- Infrastructure layer for S3 and DB operations
- Use case layer for business logic
- Controller layer for orchestration
- CUI handler for command-line interaction

### Quality Standards
- Strict typing with pyright
- Code formatting with Ruff
- Unit testing with pytest
- Clean code principles enforcement

### Documentation Standards
- Comprehensive function documentation
- Clear type hints
- Consistent naming conventions
- Well-structured domain model documentation

### Development Tools
- Python package management with uv
- Code quality tools (Ruff, pyright)
- Testing framework (pytest)
- Data processing (Apache Spark)
